# Exercises in Workbench

## Exercise 1
This exercise is to implement a simple calculation of pi based on simple integration of 4/(1+x^2)*dx.
One can implement the code in a variety of fashions.

## Exercise 2
This exercise is to implement simple OpenMP update to a serial code. Try playing
with data scope, explicit synchronisation

## Exercise 3
This exercise is to improve exercise 2. Try using local variables, reductions.
Could you alter the code to use SIMD/auto vectorisation?

## Exercise 4
This exercise is to implement task based parallelism where we try to recursively
split the integration region into smaller steps
